# Optimizely Agent
Optimizely Agent is a service which exposes the functionality of the Full Stack and Rollouts SDKs as
a highly available and distributed web application.

Optimizely Full Stack is A/B testing and feature flag management for product development teams. Experiment in any application. Make every feature on your roadmap an opportunity to learn. Learn more at https://www.optimizely.com/platform/full-stack/, or see the [documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs).

Optimizely Rollouts is free feature flags for development teams. Easily roll out and roll back features in any application without code deploys. Mitigate risk for every feature on your roadmap. Learn more at https://www.optimizely.com/rollouts/, or see the [documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/rollouts/docs).

## Getting Started
To get started with Optimizely Agent, follow the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started.md) and view example
usage in our [examples folder](./examples).

## Prerequisites
Optimizely Agent is implemented in [Golang](https://golang.org/). Golang version 1.13+ is required for developing and compiling from source.
Installers and binary archives for most platforms can be downloaded directly from the Go [downloads](https://golang.org/dl/) page.

## Running from source (Linux / OSX)
Once Go is installed, the Optimizely Agent can be started via the following `make` command:
```bash
make setup
make run
```
This will start the Optimizely Agent with the default configuration in the foreground.

## Running from source (Windows)
A helper script is available under [scripts/build.ps1](./scripts/build.ps1) to automate compiling Agent in a Windows environment. The script will download and install both Git and Golang and then attempt to compile Agent. Open a Powershell terminal and run 
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

.\scripts\build.ps1

.\bin\optimizely.exe
```

## Running via Docker
If you have Docker installed, Optimizely Agent can be started as a container. First pull the Docker image with:
```bash
docker pull optimizely/agent
```

By default this will pull the "latest" tag. You can also specify a specific version of Agent by providing the version
as a tag to the docker command:
```bash
docker pull optimizely/agent:X.Y.Z
```

Then run the docker container with:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 optimizely/agent
```

This will start Agent in the foreground and expose the container API port 8080 to the host.

Note that when a new version is released, 2 images are pushed to dockerhub, they are distinguished by their tags:
- :latest (same as :X.Y.Z)
- :alpine (same as :X.Y.Z-alpine)

The difference between latest and alpine is that latest is built `FROM scratch` while alpine is `FROM alpine`.
- [latest Dockerfile](./scripts/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.static)
- [alpine Dockerfile](./scripts/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.alpine)

## Configuration Options
Optimizely Agent configuration can be overridden by a yaml configuration file provided at runtime.

By default the configuration file will be sourced from the current active directory `e.g. ./config.yaml`.
Alternative configuration locations can be specified at runtime via environment variable or command line flag.
```bash
OPTIMIZELY_CONFIG_FILENAME=config.yaml make run
```
The default configuration can be found [here](config.yaml).

Below is a comprehensive list of available configuration properties.

More information about configuring Agent can be found in the [Advanced Configuration Notes](./docs/advanced-configuration.md).

## API

The core API is implemented as a REST service configured on it's own HTTP listener port (default 8080).
The full API specification is defined in an OpenAPI 3.0 (aka Swagger) [spec](./api/openapi-spec/openapi.yaml).

Each request made into the API must include a `X-Optimizely-SDK-Key` in the request header to
identify the context the request should be evaluated. The SDK key maps to a unique Optimizely Project and
[Environment](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/rollouts/docs/manage-environments) allowing multiple
Environments to be serviced by a single Agent.

## Webhooks

The webhook listener used to receive inbound [Webhook](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/rollouts/docs/webhooks)
requests from optimizely.com. These webhooks enable PUSH style notifications triggering immediate project configuration updates.
The webhook listener is configured on its own port (default: 8085) since it can be configured to select traffic from the internet.

To accept webhook requests Agent must be configured by mapping an Optimizely Project Id to a set of SDK keys along
with the associated secret used for validating the inbound request. An example webhook configuration can
be found in the the provided [config.yaml](./config.yaml).

## Admin API

The Admin API provides system information about the running process. This can be used to check the availability
of the service, runtime information and operational metrics. By default the admin listener is configured on port 8088.

### Info

The `/info` endpoint provides basic information about the Optimizely Agent instance.

Example Request:
```bash
curl localhost:8088/info
```

Example Response:
```json
{
    "version": "v0.10.0",
    "author": "Optimizely Inc.",
    "app_name": "optimizely"
}
```

### Health Check

The `/health` endpoint is used to determine service availability.

Example Request:
```bash
curl localhost:8088/health
```

Example Response:
```json
{
    "status": "ok"
}
```

Agent will return a HTTP 200 - OK response if and only if all configured listeners are open and all external dependent services can be reached.
A non-healthy service will return a HTTP 503 - Unavailable response with a descriptive message to help diagnose the issue.

This endpoint can used when placing Agent behind a load balancer to indicate whether a particular instance can receive inbound requests.

### Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint exposes telemetry data of the running Optimizely Agent. The core runtime metrics are exposed via the go expvar package. Documentation for the various statistics can be found as part of the [mstats](https://golang.org/src/runtime/mstats.go) package.

Example Request:
```bash
curl localhost:8088/metrics
```

Example Response:
```
{
    "cmdline": [
        "bin/optimizely"
    ],
    "memstats": {
        "Alloc": 924136,
        "TotalAlloc": 924136,
        "Sys": 71893240,
        "Lookups": 0,
        "Mallocs": 4726,
        "HeapAlloc": 924136,
        ...
        "Frees": 172
    },
    ...
}
```
Custom metrics are also provided for the individual service endpoints and follow the pattern of:

```
"timers.<metric-name>.counts": 0,
"timers.<metric-name>.responseTime": 0,
"timers.<metric-name>.responseTimeHist.p50": 0,
"timers.<metric-name>.responseTimeHist.p90": 0,
"timers.<metric-name>.responseTimeHist.p95": 0,
"timers.<metric-name>.responseTimeHist.p99": 0,
```

## Authorization
Optimizely Agent supports authorization workflows based on OAuth and JWT standards, allowing you to protect access to its API and Admin interfaces. For details, see the [Authorization Guide](./docs/auth.md).

## Notifications
Just as you can use Notification Listeners to subscribe to events of interest with Optimizely SDKs, you can use the Notifications endpoint to subscribe to events in Agent. For more information, see the [Notifications Guide](./docs/notifications.md).

## Package Structure
Following best practice for go project layout as defined [here](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

* **api** - OpenAPI/Swagger specs, JSON schema files, protocol definition files.
* **bin** - Compiled application binaries.
* **cmd** - Main applications for this project.
* **config** - Application configuration.
* **docs** - User documentation files.
* **pkg** - Library code that can be used by other applications.
* **scripts** - Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

## Make targets
The following `make` targets can be used to build and run the application:
* **build** - builds optimizely and installs binary in bin/optimizely
* **clean** - runs `go clean` and removes the bin/ dir
* **cover** - runs test suite with coverage profiling
* **cover-html** - generates test coverage html report
* **install** - installs all dev and ci dependencies, but does not install golang
* **lint** - runs `golangci-lint` linters defined in `.golangci.yml` file
* **run** - builds and executes the optimizely binary
* **test** - recursively tests all .go files
