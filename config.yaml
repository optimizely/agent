## config.yaml provides a default set of configuration options

## service author included in the /info response
author: "Optimizely Inc."
## name of the running application included in the /info response
name: "optimizely"
## version of the application included in the /info response and startup logs
## Defaults to the latest git tag `git describe --tags`
#version: custom-build

## list of SDK keys to be pre-fetched during startup (recommended for production)
#sdkkeys:
#    - <sdk-key-1>
#    - <sdk-key-2>

##
## log: logger configuration
##
log:
    ## log level used to filter logs of lesser severity (from highest to lowest):
    ## panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug
    level: info
    ## enable pretty colorized console logging. setting to false will output
    ## structured JSON logs. Recommended false in production.

##
## http server configuration
##
server:
    ## List of allowed request host values.
    ## Requests whose host value does not match either the configured server.host, or one of these, will be rejected
    ## with a 404 response.
    ## To match all subdomains, you can use a leading dot (for example .example.com matches my.example.com, hello.world.example.com, etc.).
    ## You can use the value "." to disable allowed host checking, allowing requests with any host.
    ## Request host is determined in the following priority order:
    ## 1. X-Forwarded-Host header value
    ## 2. Forwarded header host= directive value
    ## 3. Host property of request (see Host under https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request)
    ## Note: don't include port in these hosts values - port is stripped from the request host before comparing against these.
    allowedHosts:
        - localhost
    ## the maximum duration for reading the entire request, including the body.
    ## Value can be set in seconds (e.g. "5s") or milliseconds (e.g. "5000ms")
    readTimeout: 5s
    ## the maximum duration before timing out writes of the response.
    ## Value can be set in seconds (e.g. "5s") or milliseconds (e.g. "5000ms")
    writeTimeout: 10s
    ## path for the health status api
    healthCheckPath: "/health"
    ## the location of the TLS key file
#    keyFile: <key-file>
    ## the location of the TLS certificate file
#    certFile: <cert-file>
    ## IP of the host
    host: "127.0.0.1"
    ## configure optional Agent interceptors
#    interceptors:
#        httplog: {}

##
## api service configuration
##
api:
    ## the maximum number of concurrent requests handled by the api listener
#    maxConns: 10000
    ## http listener port
    port: "8080"
    ## set to true to enable subscribing to notifications via an SSE event-stream
    enableNotifications: false
    ## set to true to be able to override experiment bucketing. (recommended false in production)
    enableOverrides: true
    ## CORS support is provided via chi middleware
    ## https://github.com/go-chi/cors
#    cors:
#      ## If allowedOrigins is nil or empty, value is set to ["*"].
#      allowedOrigins: ["*"]
#      ## If allowedMethods is nil or empty, value is set to (HEAD, GET and POST).
#      allowedMethods:
#      - "HEAD"
#      - "GET"
#      - "POST"
#      - "OPTIONS"

## admin service configuration
##
admin:
    ## http listener port
    port: "8088"
##
## webhook service receives update notifications to your Optimizely project. Receipt of the webhook will
## trigger an immediate download of the datafile from the CDN
##
webhook:
    ## http listener port
    port: "8089"
#    ## a map of Optimizely Projects to one or more SDK keys
#    projects:
#        ## <project-id>: Optimizely project id as an integer
#        <project-id>:
#            ## sdkKeys: a list of SDKs linked to this project

##
## optimizely client configurations (options passed to the underlying go-sdk)
##
client:
    ## the time between successive polls for updated project configuration
    pollingInterval: 1m
    ## the number of events in a batch
    batchSize: 10
    ## the max number of events pending dispatch, setting this too low may result in events being dropped
    queueSize: 1000
    ## the maximum time between events being dispatched
    flushInterval: 30s
    ## Template URL for SDK datafile location. The template should specify a "%s" token for SDK key substitution.
    datafileURLTemplate: "https://cdn.optimizely.com/datafiles/%s.json"
    ## URL for dispatching events.
    eventURL: "https://logx.optimizely.com/v1/events"
    ## Validation Regex on the request SDK Key
    ## By default Agent assumes only alphanumeric characters as part of the SDK Key string.
    ## https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax
    sdkKeyRegex: "^\\w+(:\\w+)?$"

##
## optimizely runtime configuration can be used for debugging and profiling the go runtime.
## These should only be configured when debugging in a non-production environment.
##
runtime:
    ## SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
    ## that are reported in the blocking profile. The profiler aims to sample
    ## an average of one blocking event per rate nanoseconds spent blocked.
    ##
    ## To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1.
    ## To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.
    blockProfileRate: 0

    ## mutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention events
    ## that are reported in the mutex profile. On average 1/rate events are
    ## reported. The previous rate is returned.
    ##
    ## To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0.
    ## To just read the current rate, pass rate < 0.
    ## (For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)
    mutexProfileFraction: 0
