## [2.5.0] - Sep 24, 2021

  - Add new fields (sdkKey, environmentKey, attributes, audiences, events, experimentRules, deliveryRules) to `/config` endpoint ([PR #322](https://github.com/optimizely/agent/pull/322)):  

## [2.4.0] - March 3, 2021
## New Features
- Introduce `/decide` endpoint as a new primary interface for Decide APIs, that is for retrieving feature flag status, configuration and associated experiment decisions for users ([#292](https://github.com/optimizely/agent/pull/292)).

Upgrade to use [Go SDK v1.6.1](https://github.com/optimizely/go-sdk/tree/v1.6.1). This adds support for OptimizelyDecision.

## [2.3.1] - November 17, 2020
- Add "enabled" field to decision metadata structure

## [2.3.0] - November 2, 2020
- Introduce Agent interceptor plugins
- Adding support for upcoming application-controlled introduction of tracking for non-experiment Flag decisions

## [2.2.0] - October 5, 2020

## [2.1.0] - September 23, 2020
- For `server.allowedHosts` configuration property, add support for matching all subdomains of a host, or all hosts
- Adding batching for agent (/v1/batch endpoint), including requests in parallel
- Removed vulnerable version coreos/etcd 

## [2.0.0] - August 27, 2020
- Add SDK key validation configuration
- Reject request with invalid host (excluding port)
- Block content type other than application/json 
- Introducing support for authenticated datafiles

### Breaking Changes
- Reject requests with invalid hosts, and introduce `server.allowedHosts` configuration property
- Agent will now reject the request if the content-type is not specified from the clients
- Add Host as a configurable item
  - Previously, Agent was listening on all interfaces, and did not allow configuring the network interface that it listens on. NewServer allowed specification of a port to listen on, but not an address.
  - Now, we have added configurable HOST, with the default value set to the localhost (127.0.0.1)
  - If there is a need to deploy Agent in docker, then the Host needs to be set to 0.0.0.0. This can be achieved by setting variable `OPTIMIZELY_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0`, or setting `server.host` to 0.0.0.0 in config file.
