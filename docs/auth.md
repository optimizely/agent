# Authorization Guide

## Overview

Optimizely Agent supports authorization workflows based on OAuth and JWT standards, allowing you to protect access to its API and Admin interfaces.

There are three modes of operation:

### Issuer & Validator
Access tokens are issued by Agent itself, using a [Client Credentials grant](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/). Access tokens are signed and validated using the HS256 algorithm with a signing secret provided in configuration. Clients request access tokens by sending a `POST` request to `/oauth/token` on the port of the desired interface (by default, `8080` for the API interface, and `8088` for the Admin interface), including a client ID and secret in the request.


Issuer & Validator mode is useful if you want to implement authorization, and you are not already running an authorization server that can issue JWTs.

### Validator-only
Agent validates access tokens that were issued elsewhere. Access tokens are validated with public keys fetched from a [JWKS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) URL provided in configuration.

Validator-only mode is useful if you want to plug directly into an existing JWT-based workflow already being used in your system or organization.

### No authorization (default)
The interface is publicly available.

## Configuration
- The API and Admin interfaces are each independently configured to run in one of the above-mentioned modes of operation.
- Authorization configuration is located under the `auth` key
- Each mode of operation has its own set of configuration properties, described below.

### Issuer & Validator
The configuration properties pertaining to Issuer & Validator mode are listed below:

|Property Name|Environment Variable|Description|
|---|---|---|
|ttl|TTL|Time-to-live of access tokens issued|
|hmacSecrets|HMACSECRETS|Array of secrets used to sign & validate access tokens, using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm. Values must be base64-format strings. The first value in the array is used to sign issued access tokens. Access tokens signed with any value in the array are considered valid.|
|clients|N/A|Array of objects, used for token issuance, consisting of `id`, `secretHash`, and `sdkKeys`. Clients provide ID and secret in their requests to `/oauth/token`. Agent validates the request credentials by checking for an exact match of ID, checking that the BCrypt hash of the request secret matches the `secretHash` from configuration, and that the SDK key provided in the `X-Optimizely-Sdk-Key` request header exists in the `sdkKeys` from configuration. `secretHash` values must be base64-format strings.|

To make setup easier, Agent provides a command-line tool that can generate base64-encoded 32-byte random values, and their associated base64-encoded BCrypt hashes:
```shell script
// From the Agent root directory
> make generate_secret
Client Secret: i3SrdrCy/wEGqggv9OI4FgIsdHHNpOacrmIMJ6SFIkE=
Client Secret's hash: JDJhJDEyJERGNzhjRXVTNTdOQUZ3cndxTkZ6Li5XQURlazU2R21YeFZjb1pWSkN5eGZ1SXM4VXRLb0ZD
```

Use the hash value to configure Agent, and pass the secret value as `client_secret` when making access token requests to `/oauth/token`. For details of the access token issuance endpoint, see the OpenAPI spec file.

### Validator-only
The configuration properties pertaining to Validator-only mode are listed below:

|Property Name|Environment Variable|Description|
|---|---|---|
|jwksURL|JWKSURL|URL from which public keys should be fetched for token validation|
|jwksUpdateInterval|JWKSUPDATEINTERVAL|Interval on which public keys should be re-fetched (example: `30m` for 30 minutes)|

### No authorization (default)
The API & Admin interfaces run with no authorization when no `auth` configuration is given.

### Configuration examples
Optimizely Agent uses the [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) library for configuration, which allows setting values via environment variables, flags, and YAML configuration files.
#### Issuer & Validator
_*WARNING*_: For security, we advise that you configure `hmacSecrets` with either an environment variable or a flag, and NOT through a config file.

In the below example, the Admin interface is configured in Issuer & Validator mode, with `hmacSecrets` provided via environment variable, and other values provided via YAML config file.

```shell script
// Comma-separated value, to set multiple hmacSecrets.
// Access tokens are signed with the first value.
// Access tokens are valid when they are signed with either of these values.
export OPTIMIZELY_ADMIN_HMACSECRETS=QPtUGP/RqaXRltZf1QE1KxlF2Iuo09J0buZ3UNKeIr0,bkZAqSsZuM5NSnwEyO9Pzb6F8gGNu1BBuX/SpPaMeyM
```

```yaml
# config.yaml
admin:
    auth:
        # Access tokens will expire after 30 minutes
        ttl: 30m
        clients:
            # Either of these two id/secret pairs can be exchanged for access tokens
            - id: agentConsumer1
            secretHash: XgZTeTvWaZ6fLiey6EBSOxJ2QFdd6dIiUcZGDIIJ+IY 
            sdkKeys:
              # These credentials can be exchanged for tokens granting access to these two SDK keys
              - abcd1234
              - efgh5678
            - id: agentConsumer2
            secretHash: ssz0EEViKIinkFXxzqncKxz+6VygEc2d2rKf+la5rXM 
            sdkKeys:
              # These credentials can be exchanged for tokens granting access only to this one SDK key
              - ijkl9012
```
#### Validator-only
```yaml
# In this example, the API interface is configured in Validator-only mode
api:
    auth:
        # Signing keys will be fetched from this url and used when validating access tokens
        jwksURL: https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json
        # Siging keys will be periodically fetched on this interval
        jwksUpdateInterval: 30m
```

## Secret Rotation (Issuer & Validator mode)
To support secret rotation, both `hmacSecrets` and `clients` support setting multiple values. In `hmacSecrets`, the first value will be
used to sign issued tokens, but tokens signed with any of the values will be considered valid.

## Example (Python)
For example requests demonstrating the Issuer & Validator mode, see [here](../examples/auth.py).
